Welcome! 

This is a project and template for a BYU thesis based on R Markdown and
**bookdown** (https://github.com/rstudio/bookdown).

This template provides a skeleton file structure that you can edit to create your 
thesis. The contents inside the .Rmd files provide some pointers to help you
get started, but feel free to also delete the content in each file and start
fresh.

The **bookdown** book: https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/

## Outputs

This template creates two outputs:

  1. A PDF conforming to the BYU thesis style guide. 
  2. A `gitbook`, or a book-styled website that renders mathematics beautifully
  and can be easily posted online. There is also a download button at the top
  of each page where people can download the PDF.


To build the documents, press the "Build Book" button in the "Build" pane of 
RStudio. Otherwise, you can also compile from the R prompt with 

```r
# build website
bookdown::render_book(".", config_file="_bookdown.yml", output_yaml = "_output.yml")
# build PDF
bookdown::render_book(".", "bookdown::pdf_book", config_file="_bookdown.yml")
```
