# Literature Review {#lit}

As discussed in the introduction, forecasters model novel transport modes using activity-based models, multi-agent simulation, spatial analysis, machine learning, and more. Since our research mainly focuses on activity-based models, multi-agent simulation, and the link between them both, understanding the other model frameworks is not within the scope of this project. For this reason, the following literature review outlines the strengths and weaknesses of activity-based models and multi-agent simulation, the previous attempts to model novel transport modes with activity-based models and multi-agent simulation, and the brief literature of those who have attempted to reconcile two modeling approaches within the same study. Within the scope of this paper however, it is not practical to provide a comprehensive review of all activity-based models, multi-agent simulations, or paired modeling approaches. 

## Introduction to Activity-based Models {#lit-abm}

Activity-based models are transportation models that construct daily activity patterns from behavioral choice models. They predict what activities are conducted, where those activities are conducted, the length and time of those activities, and the people involved in those activities. This detailed approach to modeling behavior allows forecasters to understand travel at a high level both spatially and temporally. According to @philip13, activity-based models generate travel demand by first modeling activity demand. Understanding the idea that all travel is generated by activities is essential to accurately representing the way people travel. This link between activity and travel allows activity-based models to model behavior especially well, which is particularly advantageous when modeling novel modes. @bowman98 also explains that activity-based models have choice models that use utility theory and logit based regression to estimate behavior. These choice models accept an array of inputs relating to person, household, and regional data, to better capture the travel behavior of any particular region. 

In addition to representing behavior accurately, another advantage to using activity-based models is that there is modal consistency between trips on the same tour (e.g., @nayak22, @hasnine21, @knapen21, @gomes21). @nayak22 explains that other existing models fail to consider the "interrelationships among trips" performed by the same individual on the same tour. For example, if you were to take your car to the gym, and then stop by the store on the way back home, wouldn't you also use your car to get from the store back to your home? Individuals will act similarly among trips of the same tour, and activity-based models account for this natural tendency. @hasnine21 explains that tour based modeling is the core of activity-based models; "tackling" every trip within a tour is essential to understanding the dynamics that exists between trips. @gomes21 explains that trip-based models, unlike activity-based models, disregard trip sequences, trips made by the same individual, and the relationship between trips and activities. Chaining trips of the same individual together, within the same tour, helps ensure modal consistency within models.

Knowing the advantages that activity-based models provide when modeling travel behavior, many forecasters use activity-based models to model the behavior and service capabilities of novel modes. For example, some new technologies that have been modeled with activity-based models are car-sharing (e.g., @nguyen22, @li18b) and autonomous vehicles (e.g., @xu19, @vyas19). @nguyen22 modeled one-way car-sharing services with an activity-based model because the modal consistency between trips allowed them to track vehicle demand, pricing, and other parameters. @xu19 modeled privately-owned autonomous vehicles with an activity-based model as a way to better understand their impact on household travel patterns, including very large households.  @macfarlane21 used an activity-based model to model on-demand wheelchair accessible microtransit vehicles. This activity-based model generated daily activity patterns for all individuals in the region, including those who were wheelchair dependent. With those plans they were able to simulate microtransit vehicles with a microsimulation tool, and process the results to understand service capabilities. @tzouras22 conducted a quantitative study of activity-based models for modeling e-scooters. They agreed that activity-based models are an effective vehicle to describe the spatiotemporal variation in e-scooters, and novel modes in general. @muhammad19 used an activity-based model to model bike share and the concept of Mobility as a Service, which aims to make public transport a pay-per-service or monthly subscription. Many forecasters elect to use activity-based models to model new transport technologies because of the behavioral representation and modal consistency they provide.

Although there are advantages to using activity-based models to model novel modes, forecasters must consider the various weaknesses that exist when using activity-based models. One of the biggest shortfalls within most activity-based models is that travel times are averaged along travel links (e.g., @rsg16, @mahmoudi21). For example, although @nguyen22 used an activity-based models to model one-way car sharing, they noted that it used the BPR function to estimate travel time. The BPR function is a regression function that estimates average travel time based on arrival flows. When using the BPR function to estimate smaller time intervals though, it becomes inconsistent. For this reason, @nguyen22 noted that it was more difficult to verify the service capabilities of the car-sharing modes. Similarly, on-demand microtransit vehicles should be modeled with variable wait time; the difference between a 4 minute wait and a 17 minute wait is significant when traveling. @macfarlane21 recognized this shortcoming, and elected to estimate the on-demand travel time by using a multi-agent simulation on top of an activity-based model. Overall, since travel time is a significant part of the mode choice utility, average travel time is a shortfall when modeling novel modes. 

Another typical weakness present in most activity-based models is their focus on individual-based behavior, instead of household-based behavior. Although it is widely known that many decisions made by humans are done collectively, little effort has been made to model travel based on intra-household interactions and group decisions making [@zhang06]. However, some forecasters have attempted to account for this shortfall (e.g., @zhang06, @neutens08, @soo09). @neutens08 and @soo09 in particular attempted to extend individual-level travel to household-level travel by assigning certain tasks (activities) to different household individuals, verifying that schedules within the same households were coherent. @zhang06 developed a household utility function to help represent the "diverse intra-household interactions". Travel behavior is more than just a set of strung together activities, and certain interactions (e.g., household-based decisions) are important to consider when modeling transport modes.

## Introduction to Multi-agent Simulation {#lit-mas}

An alternative to activity-based models for forecasting novel modes is multi-agent simulation. Multi-agent simulation, usually synonymous with the term microsimulation, models interactions between individual agents. Multi-agent simulation is a desirable tool because it allows analysis to be done on both the individual and group levels; individualized decisions can be explored (e.g., @kamel19) as well as agent to agent interactions (e.g., @bazghandi12, @amblard15, @siebers08). These agent to agent interactions and individualized decisions allow forecasters to better understand why a novel mode may or may not be chosen. For example, multi-agent simulation allows forecasters to know exactly how many users participate in a novel transport mode, which type of users are interested in a novel transport mode, and if other agents played a role in the novel transport mode choice decision.  

Along with modeling unique agents, another reason multi-agent simulation is advantageous for modeling novel modes is its transportation network and capacity constraint. Transportation networks are visual representations of the actual road networks, and allow forecasters to see the transportation decisions made by each agent. In addition to being visual tools, agents are coded to the network allowing them to interact with attributes of the network itself. For example, @dia02 used a real traffic network in their model to simulate areas of high traffic congestion. Within the model, agents could notice high congestion areas and some of them would chose to take an alternate route. Due to the interaction between individual agents and roadway conditions, realistic travel behavior is captured on a global scale.  @djavadian17 and @fujii17 also used a real transportation network to capture realistic global travel behavior. @djavadian17 explored the usage of flexible mobility systems like taxi and carpool and @fujii17 explored mixed traffic consisting of cars, pedestrians, and trams. @fujii17 even enhanced the basic transportation network system by coding various virtual driving lanes at each intersection, thus making the network even more realistic. @cetin02 describes two more benefits of road networks: one, vehicles are subject to remain on network links for a certain amount of time (according to their travel speed) and, two, a storage capacity exists for each link that once met, no more vehicles can enter. By using a transportation network, the travel times, speeds and congestion become reliable model outputs, and therefore, the travel times, speeds, and congestion of novel modes are easily modeled. Multi-agent simulation uses unique agents with a realistic transportation network to create attainable and reliable model outputs.   

Due to the advantages that multi-agent simulation provides, various forecasters have elected to use them to model novel transport modes. For example, @kamel19 chose to use a multi-agent simulation to model shared autonomous vehicles because decision-making was done on an individual level. This granularity helped the researchers understand how user preferences affected the modal split of shared autonomous vehicles. @horl19b also analyzed shared autonomous vehicles with a multi-agent simulation, mainly to take advantages of the detailed network dynamics. By utilizing the detailed network, the researchers were able to estimate the system performance, wait times, and cost of various autonomous vehicle fleets. Other analyses have been completed on other novel modes like with shared mobility (e.g., @ciari16, @shimizu13, @becker20) and electric vehicles (e.g., @sanchez19). Specifically, @ciari16 summarizes a multitude of research done to understand demand for car-sharing with the multi-agent simulation model MATSim. In this research, they note that although multi-agent simulation provides an extensive level of detail, it does not necessarily equate to real world accuracy. A model rich in detail and with extensive behavioral rules, however, allows innovative transportation technologies to be analyzed efficiently in a world where "solid behavioral knowledge does not yet exist". Therefore, by using MATSim, @ciari16 surpassed the typical pitfalls of modeling a new transport mode like car-sharing, and adequately modeled the individual travel decisions with a high temporal and spatial resolution. Similarly, @becker20 used MATSim to model different shared mobility services (car-sharing, bike-sharing, ride-hailing). By using a multi-agent simulation, multiple novel transport modes could be analyzed simultaneously within the same model. Many forecasters continue to analyze new transportation technologies with multi-agent simulation because its inherit advantages are helpful to understanding service capabilities.

Although the advantages within multi-agent simulation are useful to modeling novel modes, forecasters must be aware of the weaknesses within these models as well. For example, although @kamel19 used multi-agent simulation to model shared autonomous vehicles, they understood that the homogeneous behavior structure may decrease the accuracy of their results. A homogeneous behavior structure means that all agents within the model have similar preferences when facing decisions, like mode choice. This renders results to be less accurate since oftentimes people choose a specific mode based solely on their personal preference. @tchappi18 reviews many of the advantages of a holonic multi-agent simulation (holonic meaning to divide the system into dependent groupings), but acknowledges the weakness that driver behavior is not homogeneous. The other major weakness of multi-agent simulations is their high computational requirements (e.g., @siebers08, @cetin02, @adler05). In order to adequately model the individualized nature of every agent, while mapping each agent to a detailed road network, affluent computing power is needed. The need for a high processing computer and sufficient computing time is indeed a limitation for some forecasters.

Another inherit weakness of most multi-simulation models is its focus on trips-based modeling. Most multi-simulation models only simulate agents on a trip level, ignoring the tour-based framework present in most activity-based models. Figure \@ref(fig:fig-mode-compare) provides a visual example of this difference. If a person wants to go to their work activity by train, an activity-based model knows that they can either walk or take transit to their gym activity. Contrastingly, a multi-agent simulation bases mode choice on the first trip of the day. This means that a multi-agent simulation will determine the optimal mode to go to the gym in, and then figure our how to get to work based on the first trip mode. In addition, an activity-based model knows that when a person leaves for lunch from their work activity, they will be returning back to their work activity after lunch. This means that the person is able to leave their car at work and possibly walk or take transit to and from their lunch activity. In a multi-agent simulation though, if someone goes to lunch, they will most likely take their car as to not abandon their vehicle for the rest of their day. It is clear that a multi-agent simulation's mode choice is less representative of how people actually transport themselves during the day. An activity-based model provides a better representation of mode choice. In this research we attempt to link a activity-based model and a multi-agent simulation tool as to use the advantages of both models to better model novel transport modes.

## Limited Attempts to Pair Two Disparate Modeling Approaches

The varying strengths and weaknesses within both activity-based models and multi-agent simulation point to possibly using both approaches to understand novel mode behavior. Yet few forecasters have attempted to reconcile or pair these two disparate approaches in order to better understand novel mode behavior. However, one example of reconciling the traditional approaches is with the system MITO (e.g., @moeckel20, @zwick21). MITO stands for Microsimulation Transport Orchestrator, and its primary purpose is to overcome the limitations of the traditional trip-based model while being easier to implement than the traditional activity-based model. Like a multi-agent simulation, MITO simulates each agent individually, however, MITO also restricts agents of the same household with a travel time budget. This travel time budget influences destination choice, and ensures that agents participate in sensible activities (e.i. those household members who commute to work are less likely to perform shopping and discretionary activities). MITO includes a simplified activity schedule builder, allows forecasters to add attributes, allows agent tracing, and is not as computationally heavy as traditional multi-agent simulations [@moeckel20]. @zwick21 used MITO to estimate travel demand and MATSim, a multi-agent simulation tool, to simulate that demand. By pairing together MITO and MATSim, the researchers were able to gather service criteria for a novel transport mode: pooled on-demand ride hailing vehicles. 

Traditionally, MATSim implements a feedback loop to determine mode choice instead of using a discrete choice model. For example, if in one iteration too many agents choose a car mode and travel times go up, in the next iteration some agents will opt to use an alternative mode. This process continues until equilibrium is found between the supply and demand. Some researches have attempted, however, to pair together a discrete mode choice model with MATSim in attempt to shorten the number of iterations needed to be run. For example, @horl19 discovered that by using a discrete choice model within MATSim, no irrelevant mode choice decisions were made. This indeed, lead to less iterations being run. However, although initial modal decisions were more accurate than the default MATSim model, the discrete choice model added a layer of complexity. Accurate and consistent data is needed in order for the discrete choice model to work effectively. This need for more data gives the model runners less freedom. @horl19 mentions that their research was merely an introduction to the concept, and further research is desirable to understanding all the benefits of linking discrete choice and simulation based tools.

Another example of pairing together two different modeling approaches is with an activity-based model and a dynamic traffic assignment model (e.g., @zhang18, @pendyala17, @shiftan00). Dynamic traffic assignment models are useful as they understand time-dependent interactions, simulate individual agents, capture congestion, and can model new transportation technologies [@zhang18]. Pairing together activity-based models and dynamic traffic assignment models is of great interest to forecasters, as their structures are similar and together they produce results at a finer level of detail. @zhang18 paired together InSITE, an activity-based model, with DTALite, a dynamic traffic assignment model, to model travel demand in the Baltimore-Washington region. Their conclusion was that the integrated model performed better than the singular InSITE activity-based model. Overall, they determined that the integrated model produced better results, but was more challenging to run and required consistent upkeep to ensure consistency between models. 

To the authors knowledge, no previous literature exists on pairing together an activity-based model with a multi-agent simulation for the purpose of modeling novel mode behavior. (We view the work done by @nate as an exception, because this research was specifically designed to build on top of that work). Yet both activity-based models and multi-agent simulation have their own unique strengths when it comes to modeling novel modes. Could using both an activity-based model and a multi-agent simulation within the same study maximize each model's strengths while limiting each model's weaknesses? There exists a need to understand which methodology is best for modeling novel modes, or if a best methodology even exists. The objective of this study is to better understand the effects of using different mode choice combinations between varying activity-based models and multi-agent simulation combinations. We aim to use these results to provide forecasters guidance as to which choice model combination they should use to model novel modes.
