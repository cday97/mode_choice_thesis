# Literature Review

As discussed in the introduction, forecasters model novel transport modes using ABMs, MAS models, spatial analysis, machine learning, and more. Since our research mainly focuses on ABMs, MAS models, and the link between them both, understanding the other model frameworks is not within the scope of this project. For this reason, the following literature review outlines the strengths and weaknesses of ABMs and MAS models, the previous attempts to model novel transport modes with ABMs and MAS models, and the brief literature of those who have attempted to reconcile two modeling approaches within the same study. 

## ABM Introduction

ABMs are transportation models that construct daily activity patterns from behavioral choice models. They predict what activities are conducted, where those activities are conducted, the length and time of those activities, and the people involved in those activities. This detailed approach to modeling behavior allows forecasters to understand travel at a high level both spatially and temporally. According to @philip13, ABMs generate travel demand by first modeling activity demand. Understanding the idea that all travel is generated by activities is essential to accurately representing the way people travel. This link between activity and travel allows ABMs to model behavior especially well, which is particularly advantageous when modeling novel modes. @bowman98 also explains that ABMs have choice models that use utility theory and logit based regression to estimate behavior. These choice models accept an array of inputs relating to person, household, and regional data, to better capture the travel behavior of any particular region. 

In addition to representing behavior accurately, another advantage to using ABMs is that there is modal consistency between trips on the same tour (e.g., @nayak22, @hasnine21, @knapen21, @gomes21). @nayak22 explains that other existing models fail to consider the "interrelationships among trips" performed by the same individual on the same tour. For example, if you were to take your car to the gym, and then stop by the store on the way back home, wouldn't you also use your car to get from the store back to your home? Individuals will act similarly among trips of the same tour, and ABMs account for this nature tendency. @hasnine21 explains that tour based modeling is the core of ABMs; "tackling" every trip within a tour is essential to understanding how dynamics that exists between trips. @gomes21 explains that trip-based models, unlike ABMs, disregard trip sequences, trips made by the same individual, and the relationship between trips and activities. Chaining trips of the same individual together, within the same tour, helps ensure modal consistency within models.

Knowing the advantages that ABMs provide when modeling travel behavior, many forecasters use ABMs to model the behavior and service capabilities of novel modes. For example, some new technologies that have been modeled with ABMs are car-sharing (e.g., @nguyen22, @li18b) and autonomous vehicles (e.g., @xu19, @vyas19). @nguyen22 modeled one-way car-sharing services with an ABM because the modal consistency between trips allowed them to track vehicle demand, pricing, and other parameters. @xu19 modeled privately-owned autonomous vehicles with an ABM as a way to better understand their impact on household travel patterns, including very large households.  @macfarlane21 used an ABM to model on-demand wheelchair accessible microtransit vehicles. The ABM generated daily activity patterns for all individuals in the region, including those who were wheelchair dependent. With those plans they were able to simulate microtransit vehicle with a microsimulation tool, and process the results to understand service capabilities. @tzouras22 conducted a quantitative study of ABMs for modeling e-scooters. They agreed that ABMs are an effective vehicle to describe the spatiotemporal variation in e-scooters, and novel modes in general. @muhammad19 used an ABM to model bike share and even the concept of Mobility as a Service, which aims to make public transport a pay-per-service or monthly subscription. Many forecasters elect to use ABMs to model new transport technologies because of the behavioral representation and modal consistency they provide.

Although there are advantages to using ABMs to model novel modes, forecasters must consider the various weaknesses that exist when using ABMs. One of the biggest shortfalls within most ABMs is that travel times are averaged along travel links (e.g., @rsg16, @mahmoudi21). For example, although @nguyen22 used an ABM to model one-way car sharing, they noted that it used the BPR function to estimate travel time. The BPR function is a regression function that estimates average travel time based on arrival flows. When using the BPR function to estimate smaller time intervals though, it becomes inconsistent. For this reason, @nguyen22 noted that it was more difficult to verify the service capabilities of the car-sharing modes. Similarly, on-demand microtransit vehicles should be modeled with variable wait time; the difference between a 4 minute wait and a 17 minute wait is significant when traveling. Overall, since travel time is a significant part of the mode choice utility, average travel time is a shortfall when modeling novel modes. *talk about other weaknesses*
