abstract: |
  This document describes the use of a new \LaTeX \ template for writing masters
  theses at Brigham Young University. This was made necessary by the relative age
  and complication of prior templates. Additionally, the new `cosmodown` R package
  contains an implementation of this thesis in R markdown, with the help of the 
  [`thesisdown`](https://github.com/ismayc/thesisdown) package.

  The abstract of a thesis should describe the
  motivation, objective, overall results, and central findings of the thesis.
  It may have multiple paragraphs if necessary.

  
acknowledgments: |
  Students should acknowledge funding sources. They may also use the
  acknowledgment page to express appreciation for the committee members, friends
  or family who provided assistance in research, writing or technical aspects of
  the dissertation, thesis or selected project. Acknowledgements should be simple
  and in good taste.
