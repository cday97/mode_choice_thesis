abstract: |
  | The advent of ride-hailing and other novel transport modes has challenged forecasters to develop new methods of capturing behavior and estimating service capabilities. Level of service for ride-hailing and other novel modes have been forecasted with activity-based models, multi-agent simulations, spatial analysis, survey data and statistical methods, and even machine learning approaches. As each approach is vastely different, forecasters have experienced a certain level of confusion when electing which approach to use to forecast level of service. In this paper, we examine ride-hailing ridership, slevel of service, and utilization generated by different activity-based model and multi-agent simulation mode choice combinations. Using ActivitySim as the activity-based model and BEAM as the multi-agent simulation, we establish 10 different mode choice combinations to analyze ride-hailing service capabilities for a Salt Lake City, Utah case study region. By analyzing ride-hailing ridership, utilization, and wait times we determine some promising approaches to modeling ride-hailing service capabilities and ridership using a linked activity-based model and multi-agent simulation. We determine that in general, linking an activity-based model and a multi-agent simulation is a promising methodology to forecasting service capabilities of ride-hailing, especially if the ride-hailing choice is kept to only one of those modeling tools. We also determine that using the combination of path, person, and location type variables to calculate the mode choice utility may predict an increase in pooled ride-haling ridership than only using path type variables. Overall, the results of our research show that the combination of modeling software, mode choice model, and utility parameters greatly affects ride-hailing ridership and level of service forecasts.


acknowledgments: |
  I would first like to acknowledge my advisor and friend, Dr. Gregory Macfarlane, for teaching me everything I know. Without you, this thesis and my future career would be boring and stupid. I found a work to love and enjoy while researching under your supervision, and for that I will forever be grateful. I express gratitude as well to Dr. Shultz and Dr. Williams for being on my advisory committe and helping me finish my thesis. I would also like to acknowledge the United States Department of Transportation (USDOT) for funding my research. Thank you to the members of the T-SCORE center, especially Dr. Gregory Erhardt, Jawad Hoque, and Vedant Goyal for their friendship and help with tackling BEAM. A special shoutout to Nate Lant and Hayden Atchley for working on ActivitySim and BEAM even when we had no idea what we were doing. Together, we got this thing done. I am enormously grateful as well to Zachary Needell at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory for working with the T-SCORE team and I in our efforts to tame BEAM. Without you, none of this would have been possible. An additional thanks to Wasatch Front Regional Council, especially Chad Worthen, for sharing data and working with our group. I express sincere gratitude for my family members and their patience and support as I conducted this research. Especially, thank you to my wife Megan, because without her I would probably be dead. She convinced me to apply for this research position, held down the fort at home, let me work every Saturday for 3 years, and was patient with me everytime I went insane staring at my computer screeen. I appretiate you all. Finally, thank you to the BYU tennis courts and Kevin Lunt, because tennis is the key to happiness.
