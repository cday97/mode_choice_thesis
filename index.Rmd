abstract: |
  | The advent of novel transport modes has challenged forecasters to develop new methods of capturing behavior and estimating service capabilities. Bike share, e-scooter, ride hail, and autonomous vehicles have been forecasted with activity-based models, multi-agent simulations, spatial analysis, survey data and statistical methods, and even machine learning approaches. Methodologies to model new transport technologies are dissimilar and difficult to access. In this paper, we examine novel mode forecasts generated by different activity-based model and multi-agent simulation mode choice combinations. Using ActivitySim as the activity-based model and BEAM as the multi-agent simulation, we establish 10 different mode choice combinations to analyze ride hail service capabilities for a Salt Lake City, Utah case study region. By analyzing ride hail ridership, utilization, and wait times we determine two effective approaches to modeling novel modes using a linked activity-based model and multi-agent simulation. We also determine that linking an activity-based model and a multi-agent simulation is a valid methodology to forecasting novel modes, especially if novel mode choice is kept to only one of those modeling tools. Lastly, we conclude that using the combination of path, person, and location type variables to calculate the mode choice utility is more effective than only using path type variables. Overall, the results of our research give direction to those struggling to forecast new transport technologies with the current disarray of modeling approaches.

  
acknowledgments: |
  I would first like to acknowledge my advisor and friend, Dr. Gregory Macfarlane, for teaching me everything I know. Without you, this thesis and my future career would be boring and stupid. I found a work to love and enjoy while researching under your supervision, and for that I will forever be grateful. I express gratitude as well to Dr. Shultz and Dr. Williams for being on my advisory committe and helping me finish my thesis. I would also like to acknowledge the United States Department of Transportation (USDOT) for funding my research. Thank you to the members of the T-SCORE center, especially Dr. Gregory Erhardt, Jawad, and Vedant for their friendship and help with tackling BEAM. A special shoutout to Nate Lant and Hayden Atchley for working on ActivitySim and BEAM even when we had no idea what we were doing. Together, we got this thing done. I am enormously grateful as well to Zachary Needell at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory for working with the T-SCORE team and I in our efforts to tame BEAM. Wihtout you, none of this would have been possible. An additional thanks to Wasatch Front Regional Council, especially Chad, Josh, and Bert for sharing data and working with our group. I express sincere gratitude for my family members and their patience and support as I conducted this research. Especially, thank you to my wife Megan, because without her I would probably be dead. She convinced me to apply for this research position, held down the fort at home, let me work every Saturday for 3 years, and was patient with me everytime I went insane staring at my computer screeen. I appretiate you all. Finally, thank you to the BYU tennis courts and Kevin Lunt, because you guys helped me stay sane day after day. 

  Students should acknowledge funding sources. They may also use the
  acknowledgment page to express appreciation for the committee members, friends
  or family who provided assistance in research, writing or technical aspects of
  the dissertation, thesis or selected project. Acknowledgements should be simple
  and in good taste.
