abstract: |
  | The advent of on-demand transport modes such as ride-hailing and microtransit has challenged forecasters to develop new methods of forecasting the use and impacts of such modes. In particular, there is some professional disagreement about the relative role of activity-based transportation behavior models — which have detailed understanding of the person making a trip and its purpose —  and multi-agent demand simulations which may have a better understanding of the availability and service characteristics of on-demand services. A particular question surrounds how the relative strengths of these two approaches might be successfully paired in practice. Using daily plans generated by the activity-based model ActivitySim as inputs to the BEAM multi-agent simulation, we construct nine different methodological combinations by allowing the choice to use a pooled ride-hail service in ActivitySim, in BEAM with different utility functions, or in both. Within each combination, we estimate ride-hailing ridership and level of service measures. The results suggest that a multi-agent simulation may overstate the demand interest relative to an activity-based model, but there may be opportunities in future research to implement feedback loops to strengthen the accuracy of ridership and level of service forecasts. 
  


acknowledgments: |
  I would first like to acknowledge my advisor and friend, Dr. Gregory Macfarlane, for teaching me everything I know. Without you, this thesis and my future career would be boring and stupid. I found a work to love and enjoy while researching under your supervision, and for that I will forever be grateful. I express gratitude as well to Dr. Shultz and Dr. Williams for being on my advisory committe and helping me finish my thesis. I would also like to acknowledge the United States Department of Transportation (USDOT) for funding my research. Thank you to the members of the T-SCORE center, especially Dr. Gregory Erhardt, Jawad Hoque, and Vedant Goyal for their friendship and help with tackling BEAM. A special shoutout to Nate Lant and Hayden Atchley for working on ActivitySim and BEAM even when we had no idea what we were doing. Together, we got this thing done. I am enormously grateful as well to Zachary Needell at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory for working with the T-SCORE team and me in our efforts to tame BEAM. Without you, none of this would have been possible. An additional thanks to Wasatch Front Regional Council, especially Chad Worthen, for sharing data and working with our group. I express sincere gratitude for my family members and their patience and support as I conducted this research. Especially, thank you to my wife Megan, because without her I would probably be dead. She convinced me to apply for this research position, held down the fort at home, let me work every Saturday for 3 years, and was patient with me everytime I went insane staring at my computer screeen. I appretiate you all. Finally, thank you to the BYU tennis courts and Kevin Lunt, because tennis is the key to happiness.
