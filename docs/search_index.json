Although travel is theorized to be derived from activity participation, the FSM focuses on modeling with trip-based not activity-based travel methods. The methodology presented in the FSM is mostly universal. The FSM can be divided up into two stages. The first defining the traveler and land use characteristics and the second where demand is loaded onto a transportation network and travel characteristics are determined (McNally 2000). As its name suggests, the FSM includes four different steps: trip generation, trip distribution, mode choice, and route choice. In trip generation the magnitude of total trips is estimated and in trip distribution those trips are disbursed along different directions of travel. In mode and route choice, a multitude of variable are used to determine specifically how travel occurs. Of the four steps in the FSM, mode choice in particular is a diverse, variable, and disaggregate step among different modeling applications. According to McNally (2000), mode choice is almost exclusively modeled on a disaggregate level within separate choice-based sampling. Choice probabilities are calculated on the individual trip level. McNally (2000) also mentions that with transit, carpooling vehicles, automobile tolls, and other new factors the mode choice algorithm can become extensive and difficult to determine. One common method used to estimate mode choice probabilities is a nested logit model (see Section 3.2). These mode choice models can reflect trip-maker characteristics as well as multiple performance variables (Ortuzar and G.Willumsen 1994; McNally 2000). 3.2 Discrete Choice Modeling "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed).
