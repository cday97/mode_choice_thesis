These experiments were performed using ActivitySim as the activity-based model and BEAM as the multi-agent simulation tool. We used the Salt Lake City, Utah region as a case study for our experiments. Since ride hailing vehicles were an emerging technology in the region at the time of our study, we deemed it the appropriate novel transport mode to model in our experiments. The following section outlines the methodology for which we were able to model a novel transport mode with differing activity-based model and multi-agent simulation combinations. 4.1 ActivitySim as the Activity-based Model ActivitySim is an activity-based simulator used to generate plans for millions of agents each with their own demographic attributes (Gali et al. 2008). Instead of independently modeling each trip, ActivitySim simulates each individual by calculating their daily travel diaries and schedules. Long term decisions are made first, and then shorter term decisions are calculated based on those long term decisions (ActivitySim: An Advanced Activity-Based Travel Demand Model Built by and for Users 2021). Overall, ActivitySim is an advanced activity-based model with the same advantages and disadvantages described in Section 3.1. 4.1.1 Novel Modes in ActivitySim ActivitySim was chosen as the activity-based model in this research because built into its framework are the novel modes of ride hail and pooled ride hail. Specifically, ride hail and pooled ride hail fail under one of the four nested tiers of ActivitySims nested logit function. The nested logit function is used to calculate the mode choice utility. Figure \\(o\\) Figure 4.1: ActivitySim Nested Logit Model (MTC 2012). Describe Mode Choice Framework Describe Service Capability Framework. Average wait time, travel time, variables etc. The mode choice model within ActivitySim is the key component for how and why ride hail is estimated the way it is. ActivitySims mode choie model is composed of Additionally, understanding how ride hail works within the mode choice model is fundamental to understanding how ride hail service capabilities were estimated. 4.1.2 ActivitySim Configured to the Case Study Region ActivitySim was configured to the case study region by first gathering and generating the inputs and then by second calibrating the model. Talk about how we got inputs and calibrated model 4.2 BEAM as the Multi-agent Simulation Tool 4.3 Linking the Mode Choice of ActivitySim and BEAM In order to use Beam in conjunction with ActivitySim however, its mode choice model was updated to be more consistent with ActivitySims mode choice model. 4.4 Case Study Scenarios "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed).
