# Discussion and Conclusion {#discussion}

The results presented in Section \@ref(results) show that mode choice structure significantly affects forecasts of ride-hailing ridership and service capabilities. Slight changes to which mode choice alternatives are available in the multi-agent simulation as well as which mode choice utility function is used impacts ridership and level of service greatly. In addition, the programming of the internal multi-agent simulation choice structure has a huge effect on results. The more advanced vehicular assignment model of a multi-agent simulation may be needed for more realistic modeled service behavior, but its increased complexity may cause irrational results. In our research the multi-agent simulation had a tendency to overstate the demand interest of ride-hailing vehicles, whereas the activity-based model did not. This was especially true when mode choice innovation was turned on and available to all walk and transit users. However, the *All* model, described in Section \@ref(meth-scenarios), produced results closest to those predicted by the activity-based model (although still slightly overstated). This suggests that when the model structures of an activity-based model and a multi-agent simulation are aligned with similar utility equations and modal alternatives, optimal ride-hailing ridership and service capabilities can be produced.

The results also suggest that whether or not ride-hailing exists in the multi-agent simulation's input plans does not make a significant difference to forecasted ride-hailing ridership or wait times. However, the purpose of using an activity-based model was to assign initial ride-hailing choices to the correct agents at the correct moments of their day. Therefore, although the estimation of service capabilities remained constant within the multi-agent simulation, the activity-based model had a background affect on making ride-hailing choices more realistic. We suggest that when the multi-agent simulation takes full control of estimating ride-hailing service capabilities, while the activity-based model determines who and when uses ride-hailing vehicles, optimal forecasts for ridership and level of service can be obtained. Unfortunately however, the estimations made by the multi-agent simulation in our research overpowered the estimations made by the activity-based model in most cases. Therefore, we believe a feedback loop between the activity-based model and the multi-agent simulation is needed to strengthen the forecasting power of rideihailing statistics.

## Further Research
The results suggest the need for a feedback loop between an activity-based model and multi-agent simulation. We suggest an iterative process  where the ride-hailing travel and wait times of the multi-agent simulation are inputted back into the activity-based model and the recalculated activity-based model ridership and usage values are inputted back into the multi-agent simulation. This process would continue, working off of each other, until the desired equilibrium and optimization of the ride-hailing system is achieved. Building upon the consistent mode choice model system designed in this research, this iterative process could establish more realistic and reliable ride-hailing ridership and level of service forecasts.

## Limitations
Various components of the multi-agent simulation, BEAM, were not perfected. First, the mode choice coefficients in BEAM were not calibrated to exact regional values, and did not represent a completely accurate total modal distribution. In addition, some limitations existed within the BEAM software because BEAM was in development throughout the life of this project. One example is that activity plans remained constant across each iteration. Similarly, BEAM is not a tour based model whereas ActivitySim is. The mode choice models we developed within BEAM also included a few limitations. The *All* structure had various car-matching difficulties as well as path-building difficulties. The *RideHail* structure gave the ride-hail alternative to all individuals instead of only those who had undergone across day replanning.

The two biggest limitations with the input files related to the driver fleet and the network file. The driver fleet did not factor in university and school location when statistically modeling the start location of each ride-hail vehicle. Second, the network file we used only included main roadways, because it was too difficult to develop a reliable all streets network from the resources available. The last significant limitation of the research was that the results were from the 12th iteration of a 15% scenario size. Due to our limited resources with computing power, larger scenarios with more iterations was too computationally heavy for our computers. 

## Conclusion {#conclusion}
The increasing usage of on-demand transport modes such as ride-hailing and microtransit has challenged forecasters with finding the best methodology to capturing behavior related to these new modes. Spatial analysis, activity-based models, and multi-agent simulation are common methodological approaches, but some professional disagreement exists as to which approach is best for forecasting the availability and service capabilities of on-demand services. Additional question surrounds how successful a paired activity-based model and multi-agent simulation would fare in practice. By using the daily activity plans generated by ActivitySim, an activity-based model, as inputs to BEAM, a multi-agent simulation tool, we constructed nine different model combinations where the choice of ride-hailing varied between ActivitySim and BEAM. We also adjusted the mode choice utility equation between each model combination. By analyzing the ride-hailing ridership and level of service between each methodological combination, we found that pairing an activity-based model and multi-agent simulation is a promising approach to forecasting the performance of ride-hailing services. However, in our research the multi-agent simulation had a tendency to overestimate ride-hailing ridership, while estimating realistic level of service forecasts. As a result, we believe there is an opportunity in future research to implement a feedback loop between an activity-based model and multi-agent simulation to create realistic and useful ride-hailing level of service and usage estimates.

Overall, accurately predicting the behavior and service capabilities of on-demand services is the key to a sustainable future. Ride-hailing and other novel modes are central to clean air, organized cities, and the effective movement of people. By accurately predicting the usage of ride-hailing and microtransit vehicles, we can help improve our cities and our lives. Overall, we can directly change the course of our future by how we estimate ride-hailing and other travel behavior, and so, should we not estimate it with the best approaches available? This research along with future research will help in these efforts to accurately predict the ever changing behavior and capabilities of transportation itself.
