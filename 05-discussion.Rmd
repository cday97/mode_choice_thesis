The results presented in Section \@ref(results) show that mode choice structure significantly affects forecasts of ride-hailing ridership and service capabilities. Slight changes to which mode choice alternatives are available for choice as well as which mode choice utility function is used impacts ridership and level of service greatly. In addition, the programming of the internal multi-agent simulation choice structure has a huge effect on results. The more advanced vehicular assignment model of a multi-agent simulation may be needed for more realistic modeled service behavior, but its increased complexity may cause irrational results. In our research the multi-agent simulation had a tendency to overstate the demand interest of ride-hailing vehicles, whereas the activity-based model did not. This was especially true when mode choice innovation was turned on and available to all walk and transit users. However, the *All* model, described in Section \@ref(meth-scenarios), produced results closest to those predicted by the activity-based model (although still slightly overstated). This suggests that when the model structures of an activity-based model and a multi-agent simulation are aligned with similar utility equations and modal alternatives, optimal ride-hailing ridership and service capabilities can be produced.

The results also suggest that whether or not ride-hailing exists in the multi-agent simulation's input plans does not make a significant difference to total ride-hailing ridership or wait times. However, the purpose of using an activity-based model was to assign initial ride-hailing choices to the correct agents at the correct moments of their day. Therefore, although the estimation of service capabilities remained constant within the multi-agent simulation, the activity-based model had a background affect on making ride-hailing choices more realistic. We suggest that when the multi-agent simulation takes full control of estimating ride-hailing service capabilities, while the activity-based model determines who and when uses ride-hailing vehicles, optimal forecasts for ridership and level of service can be obtained. Unfortunately however, the estimations made by the multi-agent simulation in our research overpowered the estimations made by the activity-based model in most cases. Therefore, we believe a feedback loop between the activity-based model and the multi-agent simulation is needed to strengthen the forecasting power of ridehailing statistics.

## Further Research
The results suggest the need for a feedback loop between an activity-based model and multi-agent simulation. We suggest an iterative process  where the ride-hailing travel and wait times of the multi-agent simulation are inputted back into the activity-based model and the recalculated activity-based model ridership and usage values are inputted back into the multi-agent simulation. This process would continue, working off of each other, until the desired equilibrium and optimization of the ride-hailing system is achieved. Building upon the consistent mode choice model system designed in this research, this iterative process could establish more realistic and reliable ride-hailing ridership and level of service forecasts.
