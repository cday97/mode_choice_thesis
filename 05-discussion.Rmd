# Discussion and Conclusion {#discussion}
The results presented in Section \@ref(results) show that mode choice structure significantly affects forecasts of ride-hailing ridership and service capabilities. Slight changes to which mode choice alternatives are available in the multi-agent simulation as well as which mode choice utility function is used impacts ridership and level of service greatly. In addition, the programming of the internal multi-agent simulation choice structure has a huge effect on results. When pairing together an activity-based model and a multi-agent simulation in efforts to forecast ride-hailing capabilities, the way the linked mode choice model is setup matters significantly. Although we did not conclude which model structure is most accurate in this research, we suggest to explore this idea in further research.

In addition to learning the effect mode choice model has on estimating ride-hailing ridership and level of service, we found that when modal innovation was turned on, the BEAM mode choice structures had a tendency to overstate demand when compared to ActivitySim. The results also suggest that whether or not ride-hailing exists in the multi-agent simulation's input plans does not make a significant difference to ride-hailing ridership or wait time forecasts. If the multi-agent simulation deemed a ride-hailing path as unfeasible, those agents would be reassigned a different mode. 

## Further Research
The results suggest that the primary area of further research remain at discovering which mode choice model structure estimate accurate ridership and level of service forecasts. In this research we concluded that mode choice model structure matters, but were unable to determine which among those options matches most closely to regional totals. A second area of further research could be to balance the ridership and level of service estimates between an activity-based model and multi-agent simulation using a feedback loop. We suggest an iterative process where the ride-hailing travel and wait times of the multi-agent simulation are inputted back into the activity-based model and the recalculated activity-based model ridership and usage values are inputted back into the multi-agent simulation. This process would continue, working off of each other, until the desired equilibrium and optimization of the ride-hailing system is achieved. By better aligning the two models, this iterative process could establish realistic and reliable ride-hailing ridership and level of service forecasts.

## Limitations
Various components of the multi-agent simulation, BEAM, were not perfected. First, the mode choice coefficients in BEAM were not calibrated to exact regional values, and did not represent a completely accurate total modal distribution. In addition, some limitations existed within the BEAM software because BEAM was in development throughout the life of this project. One example is that activity plans remained constant across each iteration. Similarly, BEAM is not a tour based model whereas ActivitySim is. The mode choice models we developed within BEAM also included a few limitations. The *All* structure had various car-matching difficulties as well as path-building difficulties. The *RideHail* structure gave the ride-hail alternative to all individuals instead of only those who had undergone across day replanning.

The two biggest limitations with the input files related to the driver fleet and the network file. The driver fleet did not factor in university and school location when statistically modeling the start location of each ride-hail vehicle. Second, the network file we used only included main roadways, because it was too difficult to develop a reliable all streets network from the resources available. The last significant limitation of the research was that the results were from the 12th iteration of a 15% scenario size. Due to our limited resources with computing power, larger scenarios with more iterations was too computationally heavy for our computers. 

## Conclusion {#conclusion}
The increasing usage of on-demand transport modes such as ride-hailing and microtransit has challenged forecasters with finding the best methodology to capturing behavior related to these new modes. Spatial analysis, activity-based models, and multi-agent simulation are common methodological approaches, but some professional disagreement exists as to which approach is best for forecasting the availability and service capabilities of on-demand services. Additional question surrounds how successful a paired activity-based model and multi-agent simulation would fare in practice. By using the daily activity plans generated by ActivitySim, an activity-based model, as inputs to BEAM, a multi-agent simulation tool, we constructed nine different model combinations where the choice of ride-hailing varied between ActivitySim and BEAM. We also adjusted the mode choice utility equation between each model combination. By analyzing the ride-hailing ridership and level of service between each methodological combination, we found that how one pairs an activity-based model and multi-agent simulation greatly affects the ride-hailing ridership and level of service estimates. Linking together an activity-based model and multi-agent simulation is a promising approach to forecasting the performance of ride-hailing services, however, further research is required to 1) understand which combination is best and to 2) better synchronize the estimates between the two models.

Overall, accurately predicting the behavior and service capabilities of on-demand services is the key to a sustainable future. Ride-hailing and other novel modes are central to clean air, organized cities, and the effective movement of people. By accurately predicting the usage of ride-hailing and microtransit vehicles, we can help improve our cities and our lives. Overall, we can directly change the course of our future by how we estimate ride-hailing and other travel behavior, and so, should we not estimate it with the best approaches available? By understanding the power different model structures can have in estimating ride-haling services, this research along with corresponding future research are the stepping stones in the mission to accurately predict the ever changing behavior and capabilities of transportation itself.
