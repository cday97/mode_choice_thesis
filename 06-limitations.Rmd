# Limitations
Various components of the multi-agent simulation, BEAM, were not perfected. First, the mode choice coefficients in BEAM were not calibrated to exact regional values, and did not represent a completely accurate total modal distribution. This was left alone, however, as our primary research focus was to compare the effects of different mode choice structures and not predict accurate forecasts. In addition, some limitations existed within the BEAM software because BEAM was in development throughout the life of this project. One example is that activity plans remained constant across each iteration. Similarly, BEAM is not a tour based model whereas ActivitySim is. The BEAM developers also let us know that the plans files used to create Figure \@ref(fig:sankey) were not a perfect representation of the mode choices chosen each iteration. These plans files did however give a sufficiently good idea of what was happening behind the scenes. The mode choice models we developed within BEAM also included a few limitations. The *All* structure had various car-matching difficulties as well as path-building difficulties. The *RideHail* structure gave the ride hail alternative to all individuals instead of only those who had undergone across day replanning.

The two biggest limitations with the input files related to the driver fleet and the network file. The driver fleet was developed by a fellow research student from another university, and the student did not factor in university and school location when statistically modeling the start location of each ride hail vehicle. Second, the network file we used only included main roadways, because it was too difficult to develop a reliable all streets network from the resources available. The last significant limitation of the research was that the results were from the 12th iteration of a 15% scenario size. Due to our limited resources with computing power, larger scenarios and more iterations was too computationally heavy for our computers.
