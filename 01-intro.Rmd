# Outline

Here is my outline for the entire thesis. Hopefully this will give me a rough idea of what to write about.

  1. Introduction *(5pg)*
  
    a. First/Last mile transit
    
  2. Literature Review *(20-30pg)*
  
    a. Discus Mode Choice (4-step model, ABMs, microsimulations)
    b. Discuss ActivitySim (modechoice)
    c. Discuss MATSim (modechoice)
    d. Discuss BEAM (modechoice)
    e. Figure explaining tour type and first trip difference?
    f. Variables showing path,person,location?
    
  3. Methods
  
    a. What did we add to BEAM?
    b. Algorithms
    c. How did we make scenario?
    d. What scenarios did we run? SLC + SL / Data & Calibration
    e. What tests did we run? (path, person, location effects)
    
  4. Results
  
    a. Describe tests and findings
    
  5. Discussion
  
    a. What does it mean?
    b. Limitations --> Future research recommendation
    
  6. Conclusions
  
    a. Wider implications
    b. First mile last mile
    c. climate change lol
  
    

# Introduction 

The basic outline for the literature review is as follows: 

  a. Mode choice in the Four step model
  b. Mode Choice in Discrete Choice Modeling
  g. Mode choice in Activity-based models
  h. Mode choice in Activity-Sim
  i. Mode choice in MATSim
  j. Mode choice in BEAM
  k. Mode choice difference between activity-based models and microsimulation tools
  l. Importance of multiple variables in mode choice calculation
