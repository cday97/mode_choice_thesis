## Problem Statement
On-demand transit modes, such as microtransit and ride-hailing, can make private car-centric societies more sustainable [@tirachini20]. They have the potential to exhaust less vehicular emissions, decrease roadway congestion, increase health, increase public transit usage in some cases, and be economically viable [@marquet20; @chen21]. As urban centers attempt to shift from a private car-centric environment to a multi-modal system, forecasters are challenged with modeling accurate ridership and level of service values. Since ride-haling is already heavily involved in today's transportation system, estimating the uptake of ride-hailing usage and understanding the service capabilities of ride-hailing is critical to a sustainable future.

Unfortunately, forecasting the ridership and level of service of ride-hailing and other novel modes is a challenging feat with no clear methodological approach. Individuals using ride-hailing vehicles behave differently than when using regular car modes and so understanding their behavior and the ride-hailing service capabilities is particularly challenging [@kang21; @li20; @dong20; @dean21]. In addition, the ridership of bike share, an affordable and sustainable bike rent program, has been modeled many times each with a different methodology [@hyland18; @biehl19; @cho22; @li18; @welch20; @zhou19; @song19]. Similarly, forecasters have struggled to find the best technique for estimating the ridership of e-scooters (public electric scooters) and in what locations they would be most effective [@zuniga22; @tuli21; @zhang21; @lee21; @leeb21; @hosseinzadeh21].

Many different modeling methodologies exist with the purpose of better understanding the behavior of individuals using ride-hailing vehicles and other novel modes. For example, some forecasters use activity-based models, which construct daily activity patterns to model individual travel behavior, to better understand the travel patterns of those who use novel modes [@xu19; @muhammad19; @macfarlane21]. Other forecasters use multi-agent simulation, which focuses on modeling the interactions between different agents, to understand the level of service of transport technologies [@shimizu13; @sanchez19; @horl19b]. Some use spatial analysis joint with geography data to better understand where individuals use novel modes, like pickup and drop off locations, to travel [@hyland18; @cho22; @hosseinzadeh21]. @zhou19 have even attempted to use machine learning techniques to determine the optimal mode choice between bike-sharing and taxi services. Among these, and the other strategies that exist, some profession disagreement exists as to which approach would best serve forecasters in their efforts to model the ridership and level of service of ride-hailing to create sustainable city centers. In particular, a lack of understanding exists as to if the relative strengths of an activity-based model and multi-agent simulation could be paired together successfully to model the uptake of on-demand services.

## Purpose of Research 
In this paper, we develop a series of experiments to understand the relative importance of a paired activity-based model and multi-agent simulation in forecasting the use of ride-hailing services. We do this by examining the ridership and level of service of ride-hailing predicted by different activity-based model and multi-agent simulation mode choice combinations. Specifically, we use the daily activity plans generated by ActivitySim as inputs to the multi-agent simulation BEAM to establish nine different combinations of methodolgical approach. For each methodological combination, we estimate ride-hailing ridership and level of service outputs for a Salt Lake City, Utah case study region.

The paper is organized by first presenting a brief literature review in Section \@ref(lit) on different methodological approaches used to forecast ride-hailing services. Next our specific methodological approach is explained in Section \@ref(meth) with our results explained thereafter in Section \@ref(results). A discussion on our results along with limitations and further research ideas are presented in Section \@ref(discussion). The paper concludes with a summary of our findings in Section \@ref(conclusion)
