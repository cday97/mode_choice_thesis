# Introduction 

## Problem Statement
The advent of novel transport modes has challenged forecasters to develop new methods of capturing behavior and estimating service capabilities. The usage of bike share, an affordable and sustainable bike rent program, has been modeled countless times each with a different methodology (e.g., @hyland18, @biehl19, @cho22, @li18, @welch20, @zhou19, @song19). Forecasters are riddled with determining the best technique for understanding who uses e-scooters (public electric scooters) and in what locations they would be most effective (e.g, @zuniga22, @tuli21, @zhang21, @lee21, @leeb21, @hosseinzadeh21). (sentence on e-bikes). In general, forecasters have modeled micromobility (bike share, e-scooters, e-bikes) in many ways, yet few have attempted to model multiple novel modes simultaneously (e.g., @reck21, @campbell16, @lazarus20, @mckenzie19, @younes20). Ride hail and ride share, which allow users to hire a driver, behave differently than regular car modes. Given their unique nature, understanding their behavior and service capabilities is particularly challenging (e.g., @kang21, @li20, @dong20, @dean21). Forecasters have even attempted to understand the effects of autonomous vehicles, even though to date little to no data exists on fully-autonomous vehicles (e.g., @mo22, @wadud21, @zhou20). New transport technologies are becoming more prominent each day, and equally so is the need to accurately capture their behavior. 

Various efforts have been made to model novel transport modes accurately, but since methodologies are dissimilar with one another it remains difficult to determine the best approach. For example, some forecasters have chosen to model novel transport modes with an activity-based model, which use daily activity patterns as the central tool to model an individualâ€™s travel behavior (e.g., @xu19, @muhammad19, @macfarlane21). Other forecasters use multi-agent simulation, which focus on modeling the interactions between different agents, to understand new transport technologies (e.g., @shimizu13, @sanchez19, @horl19b). **Many forecasters have modeled novel modes using a logit based regression analysis, which uses a function to understand characteristics of the modes (e.g., @welch20, @lee21, @dong20).**(delete? -- logit regression is used in abm/mas models) Some chose a simpler approach, spatial analysis and geography data, to understand new transport technologies (e.g., @hyland18, @cho22, @hosseinzadeh21). Forecasters have even attempted to use machine learning to better understand novel modes! (e.g., @zhou19). With limited data on novel transport modes, the validity of the results from each approach can be difficult to verify. 
 
## Purpose of Research 
In this paper we examine novel mode forecasts generated by different activity-based model and multi-agent simulation mode choice combinations. By examining the ride hail service capabilities between each combination, we hope to understand which mode choice combinations is best, or if a best combination even exists. Since only limited data on novel mode usage exists, it seems logical to use a trial and error approach to determine the best way to model new transport technologies. Overall, this paper aims to give forecasters additional direction in how to model novel transport modes.
