## Problem Statement
Novel modes, such as micromobility and ride-hailing, can make private car-centric societies more sustainable. They have the potential to exhaust less vehicular emissions, decrease roadway congestion, increase health, increase public transit usage in some cases, and be economically viable [@marquet20, @chen21]. As urban centers attempt to shift from a private car-centric environment to a multi-modal system, forecasters are challenged with modeling accurate ridership and level of service values. Since ride-haling is already heavily involved in today's transportation system, estimating the uptake of ride-hailing usage and understanding the service capabilities of ride-hailing as opposed to other novel modes is critical to a sustainable future.

Unfortunately, forecasting the ridership, level of service, and utilization of ride-hailing and other novel modes is a challenging feat with no clear methodological approach. Ride-hailing vehicles behave differently than regular car modes and given their unique nature, understanding their behavior and service capabilities is particularly challenging (e.g., @kang21, @li20, @dong20, @dean21). In addition, the ridership of bike share, an affordable and sustainable bike rent program, has been modeled many times each with a different methodology (e.g., @hyland18, @biehl19, @cho22, @li18, @welch20, @zhou19, @song19). Similarly, forecasters have struggled to find the best technique for estimating the ridership of e-scooters (public electric scooters) and in what locations they would be most effective (e.g, @zuniga22, @tuli21, @zhang21, @lee21, @leeb21, @hosseinzadeh21).  Overall, various attempts have been made to model the ridership, level of service, and utilization of ride-hailing and other novel modes.

Many different modeling software exists with the purpose of better understanding the travel behavior of ride-hailing vehicles and other novel modes. For example, some forecasters model the service capabilities of novel transport modes with activity-based models, which use daily activity patterns as the central tool to model an individualâ€™s travel behavior (e.g., @xu19, @muhammad19, @macfarlane21). Other forecasters use multi-agent simulation, which focuses on modeling the interactions between different agents, to understand the level of service of transport technologies (e.g., @shimizu13, @sanchez19, @horl19b). Some chose a simpler approach, spatial analysis and geography data, to model modal behavior and level of service (e.g., @hyland18, @cho22, @hosseinzadeh21). Forecasters have even attempted to use machine learning techniques (e.g., @zhou19). Among these, and the other strategies that exist, confusion exists as to which approach would best serve forecasters in their efforts to model the ridership, level of service, and utilization of ride-hailing to create sustainable city centers. We hypothesize that a linked activity-based model and multi-agent simulation would be an effective strategy to reduce such confusion. Activity-based models and multi-agent simulations are directly compatible, meaning by linking them together one can take advantage of the pros each model provides.


## Purpose of Research 
In this paper, we develop a series of experiments to understand the relative importance of a linked activity-based model and multi-agent simulation in forecasting the uptake of ride-hailing. We do this by examining the ridership, level of service, and utilization of ride-hailing generated by different activity-based model and multi-agent simulation mode choice combinations. Specifically, we use ActivitySim as the activity-based model and BEAM as the multi-agent simulation to establish 10 different mode choice combinations to analyze ride-hailing service capabilities for a Salt Lake City, Utah case study region. We choose to only model ride-hailing with the assumption that the results can then be applied to all novel modes in general.
